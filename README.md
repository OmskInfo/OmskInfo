- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OmskInfo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming 8-bit computers (Commodore 64) and microcontrollers (AVR, SAM32, nRF), as well as creating various types of audio tools and devices (Electrosmith Daisy, custom MIDI-DIN Sync converters) to support and enhance my music productions and performances.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 6502/6510 Assembler and also beginning to familiarize myself with Linux on ARM (Raspberry Pi OS Lite + KDE Desktop).
- ðŸ“« I can be reached here on GitHub or via my e-mail at omskinfo@gmail.com. You can also hear my music at omskinformation.bandcamp.com.
